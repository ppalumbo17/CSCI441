Code Example: Lab04

	This program is the completed Lab02 Flight Simulator.  This is version
    0.32a!  It will add sound and has a little plane that we can follow around.

Usage: 
    Pressing 'w' moves the camera forward and pressing 's' moves the camera back.

    Left click and dragging the mouse moves the camera around.

    Ctrl + Left click will zoom the camera in/out from our plane.

    The user can also press the 'q' or ESC key to quit the program.

Compilation Instructions:
    Simply navigate to the directory and type 'make.' main.cpp needs
    to be linked with the OpenGL / freeglut libraries and the OpenAL / freealut
    libraries.
